# Overview

## Accessing a tenants resources
Tenants are specified by a tenantID slug in the URL (see below).

```bash
http://${API_ROOT}/w/${tenantID}
```

## Approaches
We support several approaches for multitenancy. Each approach has its own set of tradeoffs (security, performance, complexity, etc).
The approach you choose will depend on your specific requirements.

### Single deployment
This is the simplest approach. All tenants share the same database and schema. The tenant is identified by a column in each table. This is the default approach.

### Single deployment seperate databases
Each tenant has its own database. The tenant is identified by the database name. This allows for better isolation between tenants.

### Multiple Deployments
Each tenant has its own deployment. This is the most secure approach. Each tenant has its own seperate database and process. 
This approach is useful when tenants have different security requirements.
