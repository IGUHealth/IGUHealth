# Endpoint
 ## Description 
 The technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as for web services providing XDS.b or a REST endpoint for another FHIR server. This may include any security context information.
 ## Structure 
 | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description 
 | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | Endpoint | 0..* | Endpoint | The technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as for web services providing XDS.b or a REST endpoint for another FHIR server. This may include any security context information. 
 | Endpoint.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | Endpoint.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | Endpoint.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | Endpoint.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | Endpoint.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | Endpoint.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | Endpoint.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Endpoint.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Endpoint.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the endpoint across multiple disparate systems. 
 | Endpoint.status | 1..1 | code | active / suspended | error | off | test. 
 | Endpoint.connectionType | 1..1 | Coding | A coded value that represents the technical details of the usage of this endpoint, such as what WSDLs should be used in what way. (e.g. XDS.b/DICOM/cds-hook). 
 | Endpoint.name | 0..1 | string | A friendly name that this endpoint can be referred to with. 
 | Endpoint.managingOrganization | 0..1 | Reference | The organization that manages this endpoint (even if technically another organization is hosting this in the cloud, it is the organization associated with the data). 
 | Endpoint.contact | 0..* | ContactPoint | Contact details for a human to contact about the subscription. The primary use of this for system administrator troubleshooting. 
 | Endpoint.period | 0..1 | Period | The interval during which the endpoint is expected to be operational. 
 | Endpoint.payloadType | 1..* | CodeableConcept | The payload type describes the acceptable content that can be communicated on the endpoint. 
 | Endpoint.payloadMimeType | 0..* | code | The mime type to send the payload in - e.g. application/fhir+xml, application/fhir+json. If the mime type is not specified, then the sender could send any content (including no content depending on the connectionType). 
 | Endpoint.address | 1..1 | url | The uri that describes the actual end-point to connect to. 
 | Endpoint.header | 0..* | string | Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
