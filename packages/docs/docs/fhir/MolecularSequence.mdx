For example, a search for sequence can be represented as `referenceSeqId-window-coordinate=NC_000001.11$lt345$gt123`, this means it will search for the MolecularSequence resource with a window on NC_000001.11 and with position >123 and <345, where in 1-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:124-344 will be revealed, while in 0-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:123-344 will be revealed. You may want to check detail about 0-based v.s. 1-based above. | MolecularSequence.referenceSeq  
 | _iguhealth-version-seq | number | The version sequence of the resource | Resource.meta.extension.where(url='https://iguhealth.app/version-sequence').value  
 | _iguhealth-author | token | The author of the resource | Resource.meta.extension.where(url='https://iguhealth.app/author').value
