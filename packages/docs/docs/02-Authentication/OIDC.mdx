# OpenID Connect

IGUHealth supports the following RFCs
* OAuth 2.0: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749
  - Authorization code grant
  - Client credentials grant
* Client Registration: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html

## Frontend React

We have react components and hooks that will setup authentication on your application.
To use it do the following:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="provider" label="Provider">

```jsx
import { IGUHealthProvider, useIGUHealth } from "@iguhealth/components";

<IGUHealthProvider
  domain={REACT_APP_FHIR_BASE_URL || ""}
  tenant={deriveTenantID()}
  clientId={"admin-app"}
  redirectUrl={window.location.origin}
>
  <App />
</IGUHealthProvider>;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
