Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

 | ClaimResponse.error.subDetailSequence | 0..1 | positiveInt | The sequence number of the sub-detail within the detail within the line item submitted which contains the error. This value is omitted when the error occurs outside of the item structure.
