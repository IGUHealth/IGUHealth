# [RFC] AccessPolicy

## Abstract

Current AccessPolicy is dictated around FHIR API (or to allow full access). 
The goal of this RFC is to introduce a new AccessPolicy that is more flexible and allows for more granular control over access to resources.
Although this Access Policy is built on top of the FHIR standard it's evaluation is not dependent on knowleadge of the FHIR API.
Instead it is modeled around the concepts of rules which evaluate to true/false and combinatorial like logic.
