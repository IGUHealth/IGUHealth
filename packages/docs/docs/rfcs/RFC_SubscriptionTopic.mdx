# [RFC] R4B Subscription Framework

## Abstract
Currently we use R4 Subscriptions see [here](../documentation/Data_Model/R4/Subscription). 
The goal of this RFC is to migrate to R4B Subscription framework, depricating and/or migrating R4 Subscriptions and to allow a higher throughput for Subscriptions.

## Background

R4B introduces a new SubscriptionTopic resource that defines the criteria for a Subscription (this was previously defined on the Subscription resource itself). 
This decouples the criteria from the client (Subscription in this case).


### Current Architecture
A few notes on the current architecture:
1. Resources are stored as a log within postgres this means querying for history API is relatively lowcost.
2. Because search_indices will be modified on updates we do filtering in memory not via SQL.

#### Diagram
```mermaid

    loop Time interval
      Worker-->Database: Retrieve active Tenants.
        Worker-->Database: Retrieve active Subscriptions for tenant.
          Worker->>Database: Set Lock against Subscription id.
          Worker->>Worker: Parse Subscription criteria into a fhir request (search request in this case).
          Worker->>Database: Query History API using _since-version with latestVersion being pulled from cache (if not set use Subscription versionId).
          Worker->>Worker: Filter History poll against parsed Subscription criteria (means executing fhirpath from searchparameter resources used in criteria).
          Worker->>Client: Push data matching criteria to client.
        Client->>Worker: Acknowledge data received (if not received within a certain time frame Subscription.status will be set to error).
    end

```

* Definitions:
  * Worker: Node process
  * Database: Postgres and/or Redis
  * Client: Endpoint defined by subscription where data gets sent too.


## Problem

### Issues with current implementation

* Acknowledgement of data is waited on loop which will lead to low throughput and potential block.
* Uses Redlock may not be sound see [here](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html).
* Because Subscription is coupled with client, duplicate work is likely to occur.
* Storage of latest version not in DB but instead on cache (Redis).
* Is not compatible with notification framework (should use history bundle).


## Proposal
Migration to [Topic based Subscriptions](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/components.html) and implement system where throughput is not dictated by the client.

### Data Model
* [Subscription](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-subscription.html)
  defines a client that receives events from a subscription topic.
* [SubscriptionTopic](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/subscriptiontopic.html)
   defines the criteria that causes a subscription to trigger. Also defines additional filters a subscription (or client) can define.
* [Notifications Model](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/components.html#subscription-notifications)
  is the structure of what gets sent to the client.
  * First entry SubscriptionStatus or Parameters resource in R4
  * Type use R4/R4B `history` or for R5 `subscription-notification`
  * 

### End User Flow

1. Admin defines SubscriptionTopics that define criteria clients/subscriptions can subscribe too.
2. Client/User subscribes to a SubscriptionTopic by creating a Subscription Resource
   * When processing a request for a Subscription, following are some checks that a server SHOULD validate:
      * that the SubscriptionTopic is valid and implemented by the server
      * that all requested filters are defined in the requested topic and are implemented in the server
      * that the channel type is known and implemented by the server
      * that the channel endpoint is valid for the channel provided (e.g., is it a valid URL of the expected type)
      * that the payload configuration is known and implemented by the server
      * that the payload configuration is valid for the channel type requested (e.g., complies with the serverâ€™s security policy)
4. Some user sends data to server.
5. Server pushes data to client that matches criteria.

### Architecture


#### Data Model
```mermaid
classDiagram
  Resource : id text
  Resource : tenant text 
  Resource : fhir_version fhir_version
  Resource : version_id integer
  Resource : request_method text
  Resource : resource_type text
  Resource : resource jsonb
  Resource : last_updated timestamp

  SubscriptionTopicQueue : id text
  SubscriptionTopicQueue : subscriptionTopicId text
  SubscriptionTopicQueue : resource_version_id integer
  SubscriptionTopicQueue : created_at timestamp

  SubscriptionEntryPoint : subscriptionId text
  SubscriptionEntryPoint : last_entry_point integer

  Resource <|-- SubscriptionTopicQueue: resource -> version_id
  Resource <|-- SubscriptionEntryPoint: last_entry_point -> version_id
```

1. Resource Table
   * Stores all resources that are created/updated/deleted.
2. SubscriptionTopicQueue
    * Stores all resources that match a SubscriptionTopic criteria.
3. SubscriptionEntryPoint
    * Stores the last versionId that was sent to a Subscription.
    * Used as a distributed lock to prevent multiple workers from sending the same data to a Subscription.


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Worker Group [SubTopic Filter]
participant Database
participant Queue
participant Worker Group [Subscription Channel]

loop Time interval
Worker Group [SubTopic Filter] --> Database: Retrieve active Tenants.
Worker Group [SubTopic Filter] --> Database : Poll History Api for latest version
Worker Group [SubTopic Filter] -->  Worker Group [SubTopic Filter] :  Filter based on SubTopic criteria history poll
Worker Group [SubTopic Filter] ->> Queue: Push filtered data to SubscriptionTopicQueue table [topicId, resource.meta.versionId]
end

loop Time interval
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Database: Retrieve active Tenants.
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Database: Retrieve active Subscriptions for tenant.
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Database: Retrieve Latest Entry from SubscriptionEntryPoint or (create new if not exists [set as subscription.meta.versionId]).
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] ->> Database: Acquire Lock against subscription id.
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Queue: Retrieve data from Queue for Subscriptions Topic using Subscriptions latest entry.
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Worker Group [Subscription Channel]: Send data to channel.
  Worker Group [Subscription Channel] --> Database: Update SubscriptionEntryPoint with latest version.
end

```

#### Scaling


## Migration Plan

### [Option 1] Use backport option for R4 Subscription Topics (use Basic as underlying model)
See https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/components.html#subscription-topics-in-r4 for more information.

### [Option 2] Mig and Depreicate R4 Subscription Support
* Setup db-migrate to query for active Subscription resources and migrate criteria into a SubscriptionTopic resource.
* Going forward R4 Subscriptions will be deprecated and all new Subscriptions will be created using SubscriptionTopic.
