# ClientApplication
 ## Description 
 FHIR Implementation of Client Metadata from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591#section-2
 ## Structure 
 | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description 
 | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | ClientApplication | 0..* | ClientApplication | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | ClientApplication.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | ClientApplication.name | 1..1 | string | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.description | 0..1 | string | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.grantType | 1..* | code | The grant type for this client application. 
 | ClientApplication.responseTypes | 1..1 | code | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.secret | 0..1 | string | For client credentials (or other confidential authentication methods), the client secret. 
 | ClientApplication.redirectUri | 0..5 | string | Array of redirection URI strings for use in redirect-based flows such as the authorization code and implicit flows.  As required by Section 2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], clients using flows with redirection MUST register their redirection URI values. Authorization servers that support dynamic registration for redirect-based flows MUST implement support for this metadata value. 
 | ClientApplication.uri | 0..1 | uri | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.logoUri | 0..1 | uri | undefined 
 | ClientApplication.scope | 0..1 | string | undefined
