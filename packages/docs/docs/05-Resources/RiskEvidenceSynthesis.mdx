 ## Structure 
 | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description 
 | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis | 0..* | RiskEvidenceSynthesis | The RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource describes the likelihood of an outcome in a population plus exposure state where the risk estimate is derived from a combination of research studies. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.url | 0..1 | uri | An absolute URI that is used to identify this risk evidence synthesis when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this risk evidence synthesis is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the risk evidence synthesis is stored on different servers. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | A formal identifier that is used to identify this risk evidence synthesis when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. 
 | RiskEvidenceSynthesis.version | 0..1 | string | The identifier that is used to identify this version of the risk evidence synthesis when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the risk evidence synthesis author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
