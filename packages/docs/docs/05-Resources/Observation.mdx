For biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the "physiologically relevant time". This is usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection, but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
