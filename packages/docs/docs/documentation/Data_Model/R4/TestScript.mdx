   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | TestScript | 0..* | TestScript | A structured set of tests against a FHIR server or client implementation to determine compliance against the FHIR specification. 
 | TestScript.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | TestScript.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | TestScript.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | TestScript.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | TestScript.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | TestScript.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | TestScript.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | TestScript.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | TestScript.url | 1..1 | uri | An absolute URI that is used to identify this test script when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this test script is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the test script is stored on different servers. 
 | TestScript.identifier | 0..1 | Identifier | A formal identifier that is used to identify this test script when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. 
 | TestScript.version | 0..1 | string | The identifier that is used to identify this version of the test script when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the test script author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

 | TestScript.date | 0..1 | dateTime | The date  (and optionally time) when the test script was published. The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the test script changes. 
 | TestScript.publisher | 0..1 | string | The name of the organization or individual that published the test script.

 | TestScript.useContext | 0..* | UsageContext | The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts that are listed.
