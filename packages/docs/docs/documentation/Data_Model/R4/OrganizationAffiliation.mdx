   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | OrganizationAffiliation | 0..* | OrganizationAffiliation | Defines an affiliation/assotiation/relationship between 2 distinct oganizations, that is not a part-of relationship/sub-division relationship. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | Business identifiers that are specific to this role. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.active | 0..1 | boolean | Whether this organization affiliation record is in active use. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.period | 0..1 | Period | The period during which the participatingOrganization is affiliated with the primary organization. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.organization | 0..1 | Reference | Organization where the role is available (primary organization/has members). 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.participatingOrganization | 0..1 | Reference | The Participating Organization provides/performs the role(s) defined by the code to the Primary Organization (e.g. providing services or is a member of). 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.network | 0..* | Reference | Health insurance provider network in which the participatingOrganization provides the role's services (if defined) at the indicated locations (if defined). 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.code | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Definition of the role the participatingOrganization plays in the association. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.specialty | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Specific specialty of the participatingOrganization in the context of the role. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.location | 0..* | Reference | The location(s) at which the role occurs. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.healthcareService | 0..* | Reference | Healthcare services provided through the role. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.telecom | 0..* | ContactPoint | Contact details at the participatingOrganization relevant to this Affiliation. 
 | OrganizationAffiliation.endpoint | 0..* | Reference | Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for this role.
