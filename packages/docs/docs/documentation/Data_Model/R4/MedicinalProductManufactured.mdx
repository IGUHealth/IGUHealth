  <Tabs> <TabItem value="structure" label="Structure">
   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | MedicinalProductManufactured | 0..* | MedicinalProductManufactured | The manufactured item as contained in the packaged medicinal product. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.manufacturedDoseForm | 1..1 | CodeableConcept | Dose form as manufactured and before any transformation into the pharmaceutical product. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.unitOfPresentation | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The “real world” units in which the quantity of the manufactured item is described. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.quantity | 1..1 | Quantity | The quantity or "count number" of the manufactured item. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.manufacturer | 0..* | Reference | Manufacturer of the item (Note that this should be named "manufacturer" but it currently causes technical issues). 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.ingredient | 0..* | Reference | Ingredient. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.physicalCharacteristics | 0..1 | ProdCharacteristic | Dimensions, color etc. 
 | MedicinalProductManufactured.otherCharacteristics | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Other codeable characteristics.
