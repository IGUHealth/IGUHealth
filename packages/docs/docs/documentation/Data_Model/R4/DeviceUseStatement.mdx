  ## Information
  <Tabs> <TabItem value="structure" label="Structure">
   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | DeviceUseStatement | 0..* | DeviceUseStatement | A record of a device being used by a patient where the record is the result of a report from the patient or another clinician. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | DeviceUseStatement.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | An external identifier for this statement such as an IRI. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.basedOn | 0..* | Reference | A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this DeviceUseStatement. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.status | 1..1 | code | A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of the device used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be active or completed. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.subject | 1..1 | Reference | The patient who used the device. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.derivedFrom | 0..* | Reference | Allows linking the DeviceUseStatement to the underlying Request, or to other information that supports or is used to derive the DeviceUseStatement. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.timing[x] | 0..1 | Timing | How often the device was used. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.recordedOn | 0..1 | dateTime | The time at which the statement was made/recorded. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.source | 0..1 | Reference | Who reported the device was being used by the patient. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.device | 1..1 | Reference | The details of the device used. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.reasonCode | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Reason or justification for the use of the device. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.reasonReference | 0..* | Reference | Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this DeviceUseStatement. 
 | DeviceUseStatement.bodySite | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | Indicates the anotomic location on the subject's body where the device was used ( i.e. the target). 
 | DeviceUseStatement.note | 0..* | Annotation | Details about the device statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
