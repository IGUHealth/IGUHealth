   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | ResearchStudy | 0..* | ResearchStudy | A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge.  This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and investigative techniques.  A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects. 
 | ResearchStudy.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | ResearchStudy.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | ResearchStudy.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | ResearchStudy.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | ResearchStudy.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | ResearchStudy.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | ResearchStudy.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | ResearchStudy.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | ResearchStudy.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | Identifiers assigned to this research study by the sponsor or other systems. 
 | ResearchStudy.title | 0..1 | string | A short, descriptive user-friendly label for the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.protocol | 0..* | Reference | The set of steps expected to be performed as part of the execution of the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.partOf | 0..* | Reference | A larger research study of which this particular study is a component or step. 
 | ResearchStudy.status | 1..1 | code | The current state of the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.primaryPurposeType | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The type of study based upon the intent of the study's activities. A classification of the intent of the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.phase | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The stage in the progression of a therapy from initial experimental use in humans in clinical trials to post-market evaluation. 
 | ResearchStudy.category | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Codes categorizing the type of study such as investigational vs. observational, type of blinding, type of randomization, safety vs. efficacy, etc. 
 | ResearchStudy.focus | 0..* | CodeableConcept | The medication(s), food(s), therapy(ies), device(s) or other concerns or interventions that the study is seeking to gain more information about. 
 | ResearchStudy.condition | 0..* | CodeableConcept | The condition that is the focus of the study.  For example, In a study to examine risk factors for Lupus, might have as an inclusion criterion "healthy volunteer", but the target condition code would be a Lupus SNOMED code. 
 | ResearchStudy.contact | 0..* | ContactDetail | Contact details to assist a user in learning more about or engaging with the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.relatedArtifact | 0..* | RelatedArtifact | Citations, references and other related documents.

 | ResearchStudy.description | 0..1 | markdown | A full description of how the study is being conducted. 
 | ResearchStudy.enrollment | 0..* | Reference | Reference to a Group that defines the criteria for and quantity of subjects participating in the study.  E.g. " 200 female Europeans between the ages of 20 and 45 with early onset diabetes". 
 | ResearchStudy.period | 0..1 | Period | Identifies the start date and the expected (or actual, depending on status) end date for the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.sponsor | 0..1 | Reference | An organization that initiates the investigation and is legally responsible for the study. 
 | ResearchStudy.principalInvestigator | 0..1 | Reference | A researcher in a study who oversees multiple aspects of the study, such as concept development, protocol writing, protocol submission for IRB approval, participant recruitment, informed consent, data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation.
