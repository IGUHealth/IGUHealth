   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | EvidenceReport | 0..* | EvidenceReport | The EvidenceReport Resource is a specialized container for a collection of resources and codable concepts, adapted to support compositions of Evidence, EvidenceVariable, and Citation resources and related concepts. 
 | EvidenceReport.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | EvidenceReport.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | EvidenceReport.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | EvidenceReport.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | EvidenceReport.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | EvidenceReport.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | EvidenceReport.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | EvidenceReport.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | EvidenceReport.url | 0..1 | uri | An absolute URI that is used to identify this EvidenceReport when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this summary is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the summary is stored on different servers. 
 | EvidenceReport.status | 1..1 | code | The status of this summary. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content. 
 | EvidenceReport.useContext | 0..* | UsageContext | The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate evidence report instances. 
 | EvidenceReport.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | A formal identifier that is used to identify this EvidenceReport when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. 
 | EvidenceReport.relatedIdentifier | 0..* | Identifier | A formal identifier that is used to identify things closely related to this EvidenceReport. 
 | EvidenceReport.citeAs[x] | 0..1 | Reference | Citation Resource or display of suggested citation for this report.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | EvidenceReport.subject.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants.
