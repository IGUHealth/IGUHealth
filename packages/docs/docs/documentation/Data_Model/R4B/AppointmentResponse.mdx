   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | AppointmentResponse | 0..* | AppointmentResponse | A reply to an appointment request for a patient and/or practitioner(s), such as a confirmation or rejection. 
 | AppointmentResponse.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | AppointmentResponse.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | AppointmentResponse.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | AppointmentResponse.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | AppointmentResponse.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | AppointmentResponse.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | AppointmentResponse.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | AppointmentResponse.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | AppointmentResponse.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | This records identifiers associated with this appointment response concern that are defined by business processes and/ or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate. 
 | AppointmentResponse.appointment | 1..1 | Reference | Appointment that this response is replying to. 
 | AppointmentResponse.start | 0..1 | instant | Date/Time that the appointment is to take place, or requested new start time. 
 | AppointmentResponse.end | 0..1 | instant | This may be either the same as the appointment request to confirm the details of the appointment, or alternately a new time to request a re-negotiation of the end time. 
 | AppointmentResponse.participantType | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Role of participant in the appointment. 
 | AppointmentResponse.actor | 0..1 | Reference | A Person, Location, HealthcareService, or Device that is participating in the appointment. 
 | AppointmentResponse.participantStatus | 1..1 | code | Participation status of the participant. When the status is declined or tentative if the start/end times are different to the appointment, then these times should be interpreted as a requested time change. When the status is accepted, the times can either be the time of the appointment (as a confirmation of the time) or can be empty. 
 | AppointmentResponse.comment | 0..1 | string | Additional comments about the appointment.
