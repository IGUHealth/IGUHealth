 | InsurancePlan.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.

Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
