   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | SubscriptionTopic | 0..* | SubscriptionTopic | Describes a stream of resource state changes or events and annotated with labels useful to filter projections from this topic. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | SubscriptionTopic.url | 1..1 | uri | An absolute URI that is used to identify this subscription topic when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this subscription topic is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the subscription topic is stored on different servers. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | Business identifiers assigned to this subscription topic by the performer and/or other systems.  These identifiers remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.version | 0..1 | string | The identifier that is used to identify this version of the subscription topic when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the Topic author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions are orderable. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.title | 0..1 | string | A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the SubscriptionTopic, for example, "admission". 
 | SubscriptionTopic.derivedFrom | 0..* | canonical | The canonical URL pointing to another FHIR-defined SubscriptionTopic that is adhered to in whole or in part by this SubscriptionTopic. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.status | 1..1 | code | The current state of the SubscriptionTopic. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.experimental | 0..1 | boolean | A flag to indicate that this TopSubscriptionTopicic is authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine usage. 
 | SubscriptionTopic.date | 0..1 | dateTime | For draft definitions, indicates the date of initial creation.  For active definitions, represents the date of activation.  For withdrawn definitions, indicates the date of withdrawal.

 | SubscriptionTopic.purpose | 0..1 | markdown | Explains why this Topic is needed and why it has been designed as it has.
