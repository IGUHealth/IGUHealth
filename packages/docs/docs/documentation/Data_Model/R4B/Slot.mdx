   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | Slot | 0..* | Slot | A slot of time on a schedule that may be available for booking appointments. 
 | Slot.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | Slot.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | Slot.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | Slot.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | Slot.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | Slot.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | Slot.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Slot.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Slot.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | External Ids for this item. 
 | Slot.serviceCategory | 0..* | CodeableConcept | A broad categorization of the service that is to be performed during this appointment. 
 | Slot.serviceType | 0..* | CodeableConcept | The type of appointments that can be booked into this slot (ideally this would be an identifiable service - which is at a location, rather than the location itself). If provided then this overrides the value provided on the availability resource. 
 | Slot.specialty | 0..* | CodeableConcept | The specialty of a practitioner that would be required to perform the service requested in this appointment. 
 | Slot.appointmentType | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The style of appointment or patient that may be booked in the slot (not service type). 
 | Slot.schedule | 1..1 | Reference | The schedule resource that this slot defines an interval of status information. 
 | Slot.status | 1..1 | code | busy / free / busy-unavailable / busy-tentative / entered-in-error. 
 | Slot.start | 1..1 | instant | Date/Time that the slot is to begin. 
 | Slot.end | 1..1 | instant | Date/Time that the slot is to conclude. 
 | Slot.overbooked | 0..1 | boolean | This slot has already been overbooked, appointments are unlikely to be accepted for this time. 
 | Slot.comment | 0..1 | string | Comments on the slot to describe any extended information. Such as custom constraints on the slot.

 | _text | string | Search on the narrative of the resource |

 | _filter | token | Filter search parameter which supports a more sophisticated grammar for searching. See [documentation](search_filter.html) for further details |   
 | _has | string | Provides limited support for reverse chaining - that is, selecting resources based on the properties of resources that refer to them (instead of chaining where resources can be selected based on the properties of resources that they refer to). See the FHIR search page for further documentation |   
 | _id | token | Logical id of this artifact | Resource.id  
 | _lastUpdated | date | When the resource version last changed | Resource.meta.lastUpdated  
 | _list | string | All resources in nominated list (by id, Type/id, url or one of the magic List types) |   
 | _profile | uri | Profiles this resource claims to conform to | Resource.meta.profile  
 | _query | token | A custom search profile that describes a specific defined query operation |   
 | _security | token | Security Labels applied to this resource | Resource.meta.security  
 | _source | uri | Identifies where the resource comes from | Resource.meta.source  
 | _tag | token | Tags applied to this resource | Resource.meta.tag  
 | _text | string | Search on the narrative text (html) of the resource |   
 | _type | token | Used when a search is performed in a context which doesn't limit the search to indicate which types are being searched. See the FHIR search page for further discussion |   
 | appointment-type | token | The style of appointment or patient that may be booked in the slot (not service type) | Slot.appointmentType  
 | identifier | token | A Slot Identifier | Slot.identifier  
 | schedule | reference | The Schedule Resource that we are seeking a slot within | Slot.schedule  
 | service-category | token | A broad categorization of the service that is to be performed during this appointment | Slot.serviceCategory  
 | service-type | token | The type of appointments that can be booked into the slot | Slot.serviceType
