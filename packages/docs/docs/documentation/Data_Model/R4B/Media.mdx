  ## Information
  <Tabs> <TabItem value="structure" label="Structure">
   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | Media | 0..* | Media | A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare. The actual content may be inline or provided by direct reference. 
 | Media.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | Media.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | Media.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | Media.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | Media.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | Media.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | Media.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Media.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Media.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids) and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers. 
 | Media.basedOn | 0..* | Reference | A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this media. 
 | Media.partOf | 0..* | Reference | A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step. 
 | Media.status | 1..1 | code | The current state of the \{\{title\}\}. 
 | Media.type | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | A code that classifies whether the media is an image, video or audio recording or some other media category. 
 | Media.modality | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media resource, then this is the modality. 
 | Media.view | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP). 
 | Media.subject | 0..1 | Reference | Who/What this Media is a record of. 
 | Media.encounter | 0..1 | Reference | The encounter that establishes the context for this media. 
 | Media.created[x] | 0..1 | dateTime | The date and time(s) at which the media was collected. 
 | Media.issued | 0..1 | instant | The date and time this version of the media was made available to providers, typically after having been reviewed. 
 | Media.operator | 0..1 | Reference | The person who administered the collection of the image. 
 | Media.reasonCode | 0..* | CodeableConcept | Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form. 
 | Media.bodySite | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e. the target site). 
 | Media.deviceName | 0..1 | string | The name of the device / manufacturer of the device  that was used to make the recording. 
 | Media.device | 0..1 | Reference | The device used to collect the media. 
 | Media.height | 0..1 | positiveInt | Height of the image in pixels (photo/video). 
 | Media.width | 0..1 | positiveInt | Width of the image in pixels (photo/video). 
 | Media.frames | 0..1 | positiveInt | The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget is required. 
 | Media.duration | 0..1 | decimal | The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video. 
 | Media.content | 1..1 | Attachment | The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media source file. 
 | Media.note | 0..* | Annotation | Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
