  ## Information
  <Tabs> <TabItem value="structure" label="Structure">
   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | PackagedProductDefinition | 0..* | PackagedProductDefinition | A medically related item or items, in a container or package. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | A unique identifier for this package as whole. Unique instance identifiers assigned to a package by manufacturers, regulators, drug catalogue custodians or other organizations. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.name | 0..1 | string | A name for this package. Typically what it would be listed as in a drug formulary or catalogue, inventory etc. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.type | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | A high level category e.g. medicinal product, raw material, shipping/transport container, etc. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.packageFor | 0..* | Reference | The product that this is a pack for. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.status | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | The status within the lifecycle of this item. A high level status, this is not intended to duplicate details carried elsewhere such as legal status, or authorization or marketing status. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.statusDate | 0..1 | dateTime | The date at which the given status became applicable. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.containedItemQuantity | 0..* | Quantity | A total of the complete count of contained items of a particular type/form, independent of sub-packaging or organization. This can be considered as the pack size. This attribute differs from containedItem.amount in that it can give a single aggregated count of all tablet types in a pack, even when these are different manufactured items. For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.

 | PackagedProductDefinition.legalStatusOfSupply.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | PackagedProductDefinition.legalStatusOfSupply.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants.
