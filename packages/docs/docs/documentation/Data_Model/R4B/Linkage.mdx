   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | Linkage | 0..* | Linkage | Identifies two or more records (resource instances) that refer to the same real-world "occurrence". 
 | Linkage.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | Linkage.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | Linkage.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | Linkage.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | Linkage.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | Linkage.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | Linkage.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Linkage.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Linkage.active | 0..1 | boolean | Indicates whether the asserted set of linkages are considered to be "in effect". 
 | Linkage.author | 0..1 | Reference | Identifies the user or organization responsible for asserting the linkages as well as the user or organization who establishes the context in which the nature of each linkage is evaluated. 
 | Linkage.item | 1..* | BackboneElement | Identifies which record considered as the reference to the same real-world occurrence as well as how the items should be evaluated within the collection of linked items. 
 | Linkage.item.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces. 
 | Linkage.item.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Linkage.item.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Linkage.item.type | 1..1 | code | Distinguishes which item is "source of truth" (if any) and which items are no longer considered to be current representations. 
 | Linkage.item.resource | 1..1 | Reference | The resource instance being linked as part of the group. 

 ## Search Parameters

   | Name | Type | Description  | Expression 
    | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------  
 | _text | string | Search on the narrative of the resource |   
 | _content | string | Search on the entire content of the resource |   
 | _filter | token | Filter search parameter which supports a more sophisticated grammar for searching. See [documentation](search_filter.html) for further details |   
 | _has | string | Provides limited support for reverse chaining - that is, selecting resources based on the properties of resources that refer to them (instead of chaining where resources can be selected based on the properties of resources that they refer to). See the FHIR search page for further documentation |   
 | _id | token | Logical id of this artifact | Resource.id  
 | _lastUpdated | date | When the resource version last changed | Resource.meta.lastUpdated  
 | _list | string | All resources in nominated list (by id, Type/id, url or one of the magic List types) |   
 | _profile | uri | Profiles this resource claims to conform to | Resource.meta.profile  
 | _query | token | A custom search profile that describes a specific defined query operation |   
 | _security | token | Security Labels applied to this resource | Resource.meta.security  
 | _source | uri | Identifies where the resource comes from | Resource.meta.source  
 | _tag | token | Tags applied to this resource | Resource.meta.tag  
 | _text | string | Search on the narrative text (html) of the resource |   
 | _type | token | Used when a search is performed in a context which doesn't limit the search to indicate which types are being searched. See the FHIR search page for further discussion |   
 | author | reference | Author of the Linkage | Linkage.author  
 | item | reference | Matches on any item in the Linkage | Linkage.item.resource  
 | source | reference | Matches on any item in the Linkage with a type of 'source' | Linkage.item.resource
