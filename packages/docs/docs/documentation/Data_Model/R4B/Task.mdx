   ## Structure

   | Path | Cardinality | Type | Description
  | ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------  
 | Task | 0..* | Task | A task to be performed. 
 | Task.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. 
 | Task.meta | 0..1 | Meta | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
 | Task.implicitRules | 0..1 | uri | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. 
 | Task.language | 0..1 | code | The base language in which the resource is written. 
 | Task.text | 0..1 | Narrative | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. 
 | Task.contained | 0..* | Resource | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. 
 | Task.extension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. 
 | Task.modifierExtension | 0..* | Extension | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). 
 | Task.identifier | 0..* | Identifier | The business identifier for this task. 
 | Task.instantiatesCanonical | 0..1 | canonical | The URL pointing to a *FHIR*-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Task. 
 | Task.instantiatesUri | 0..1 | uri | The URL pointing to an *externally* maintained  protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Task. 
 | Task.basedOn | 0..* | Reference | BasedOn refers to a higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of the task.  It references a "request" resource such as a ServiceRequest, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest, CarePlan, etc. which is distinct from the "request" resource the task is seeking to fulfill.  This latter resource is referenced by FocusOn.  For example, based on a ServiceRequest (= BasedOn), a task is created to fulfill a procedureRequest ( = FocusOn ) to collect a specimen from a patient. 
 | Task.groupIdentifier | 0..1 | Identifier | An identifier that links together multiple tasks and other requests that were created in the same context. 
 | Task.partOf | 0..* | Reference | Task that this particular task is part of.

 | Task.statusReason | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | An explanation as to why this task is held, failed, was refused, etc. 
 | Task.businessStatus | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | Contains business-specific nuances of the business state. 
 | Task.intent | 1..1 | code | Indicates the "level" of actionability associated with the Task, i.e. i+R[9]Cs this a proposed task, a planned task, an actionable task, etc. 
 | Task.priority | 0..1 | code | Indicates how quickly the Task should be addressed with respect to other requests. 
 | Task.code | 0..1 | CodeableConcept | A name or code (or both) briefly describing what the task involves. 
 | Task.description | 0..1 | string | A free-text description of what is to be performed. 
 | Task.focus | 0..1 | Reference | The request being actioned or the resource being manipulated by this task. 
 | Task.for | 0..1 | Reference | The entity who benefits from the performance of the service specified in the task (e.g., the patient). 
 | Task.encounter | 0..1 | Reference | The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction) during which this task was created. 
 | Task.executionPeriod | 0..1 | Period | Identifies the time action was first taken against the task (start) and/or the time final action was taken against the task prior to marking it as completed (end). 
 | Task.authoredOn | 0..1 | dateTime | The date and time this task was created. 
 | Task.lastModified | 0..1 | dateTime | The date and time of last modification to this task. 
 | Task.requester | 0..1 | Reference | The creator of the task. 
 | Task.performerType | 0..* | CodeableConcept | The kind of participant that should perform the task.

 | Task.restriction.id | 0..1 | http://hl7.org/fhirpath/System.String | Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
