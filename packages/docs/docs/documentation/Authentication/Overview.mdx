# Overview

Authentication is built around tenants. Tenants are a logical seperation of resources. Each tenant will have it's own isolated set of resources.
Access to a tenant is determined by JWT tokens. JWT tokens are expected to have custom claims specifying what tenant they have access too.

## URL Structure for tenant access

Requests are structured in the following format:
URL: /w/:tenant/api/:version/fhir/:fhir_version/:\*,

- **tenant:** slug identifying the tenant a user is attempting to access.
- **version:** IGUHealth api version.
- **fhir_version:** FHIR version for the request.

## JWT Structure

JWT structure is specified in our package [@iguhealth/jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iguhealth/jwt). See README for more information.
