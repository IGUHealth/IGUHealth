# Overview

This documentation covers the API endpoints available on the IGUHealth server.
Our server is based around the FHIR standard and provides a RESTful API for interacting with FHIR resources.

## Endpoints

We support the following versions of FHIR which can be accessed via the following endpoints:

### R4
```bash
curl --request GET ${my-domain}/w/${my-tenant-id}/api/v1/fhir/r4/metadata
```

### R4B
```bash
curl --request GET ${my-domain}/w/${my-tenant-id}/api/v1/fhir/r4b/metadata
```
