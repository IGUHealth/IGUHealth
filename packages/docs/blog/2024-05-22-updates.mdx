# Updates 2024-05-22

## Admin Application Enhancements

### Better handling of 403 errors
App now displays a more user-friendly message when a user is not authorized to access a resource.
This fixes the issue where users were seeing a blank page when they were not authorized to access a resource.

### Invite operation
We have added an invite operation to the admin application. You can now invite users to your organization by providing their email address.

### Server Usage Display
We have added a display to show the current server usage in the admin application. This will help you keep track of your server usage and plan accordingly.

## Server Enhancements

### Validation Performance
We have improved the performance of validation operations. You should see a significant improvement in the time taken to validate resources and perform CRUD operations.
(We have seen a 50% improvement in validation times.).

### Improved Login Flow
Login flow now will automatically direct users to admin-app if not directed too from the authorize endpoint (which will redirect to the client specified by client_id and redirect_url).

### Email Templates
Emails being sent are now formatted using our email templates.

## General
