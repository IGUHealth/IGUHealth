# Updates 2024-09-10

## Server

### Security

#### AccessPolicy V2

We have added support for a new version of the AccessPolicy resource.
This version allows for more fine-grained control over access to resources.
We use a rule engine based on XACML to evaluate whether a user can perform a given request.
This is evaluated using fhirpath expressions on the request and the user's claims.

More information can be found in our [RFC](/rfcs/RFC_AccessPolicy)

## General

### FHIRPath

We've rewritten our FHIRPath parser to be more performant.
Currently, we've seen a roughly 60% improvement in parsing time.
This will allow us to index resources faster and improve the performance of our FHIRPath queries.

### Expression component
We've added a new component to our component library that allows you to view FHIRPath expressions.
We have written a custom codemirror mode to highlight and format FHIRPath expressions.

### Meta values
We've altered the way we pull type information about resources.
We've created a pre-generated hashtable of type information per resource and use this to validate resources and for type information in our FHIRPath queries.
