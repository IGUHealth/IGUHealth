# Updates 2024-06-05

## Server Enhancements

### Alterations to the User Data Model
Our data model had the concept of a root user that could be connected to multiple tenants. This was done to allow a user to easily access multiple tenants that they were a member of.
We've removed this, and instead, each user is now entirely isolated and connected to a FHIR Membership resource.

### Tenant Discovery
On root login, we now return a list of tenants that a user is registered with (via email). After selecting a tenant a user is directed to that tenants login.

## Local Development

### Docker
We now have the following Docker compose files for local development:

* docker/services-compose.yml: Will setup all the services needed for local development.
* docker/iguhealth-compose.yml: Will setup services and the iguhealth server and admin app.

## Security

### OperationDefinition Execution
OperationDefinitions must now be tied to an AccessPolicy resource to access and mutate data back on the server.
