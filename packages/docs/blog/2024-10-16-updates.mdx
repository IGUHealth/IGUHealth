# Updates 2024-10-08

## Admin App

* We've added support for testing AccessPolicyV2 resources in the admin app. This allows you to test your AccessPolicyV2 resources and see the results of the evaluation.

### UI
* Added simplified views for Subscription creation/deletion and viewing.
* Condensed sidebar text
* Added IDP configuration

## Server

* We've altered how Operation Definitions are deployed. We now require users to deploy via the $deploy [operation](https://github.com/IGUHealth/IGUHealth/blob/main/artifacts/r4/iguhealth-core/definitions/iguhealth/operation/deploy.json).
This operation is invoked at the Operation Definition instance level and takes the code and environment variables as input parameters.

### Security

#### OIDC
* We've added support for SMART on FHIR patient scopes. We use the HL7 patient compartment definition to determine which resources are accessible by a given patient scope.

#### Federated Identity
* We've added support for federated identity providers. This allows you to authenticate users via an external identity provider such as Azure, Okta, or Auth0.
You can read more about this [here](/documentation/Security/External%20Identity%20Providers/Getting%20Started)

## General

We are beginning work on performance improvements for single-value search parameters (search parameters whose type is not a collection).
We are currently working on an optimized index for these parameters to improve search performance.

### Updated Packages
* @iguhealth/server: 0.23.4
* @iguhealth/admin-app: 0.16.0
