# Updates 2024-11-23

## Profiling
We've now added support for profiling. You can read more about profiling [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html).

#### Support
* [Slicing](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing): Allows you to validate sublists of items.
  * Type Slicing: We support slicing based on type; this allows you to add additional constraints on a type from a typechoice.
  * Pattern Slicing: Slice based on a pattern defined in the discriminator.
  * Fixed Value Slicing: Slice based on a fixed value defined in the discriminator.
* Nested Profiles: We allow you to create and extend profiles from other profiles.
* Cardinality: Support for restricting cardinality on elements.
* Patterns: Support for defining patterns on elements.
* Fixed Values: Support for defining fixed values on elements.

## Server

* We've added support for US Core profiles. You can now use the US Core profiles in your FHIR resources. 
  You can read more about the US Core profiles [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU4/index.html).

## Admin App

* We've altered the Subscription editor to support a simple editor for creating Subscriptions
* Subscriptions built in the admin app now automatically adhere to our https://iguhealth.app/resource/Subscription profile.


## Artifacts
