# Updates 2024-07-19

## Terminology
We now support the following external terminologies:
* [BCP-13 Media Types](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp13)
* [ISO-4217 Currency codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html)
* [ISO-3166 Country Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)

We will be adding support for Loinc, ICD-10, and RxNorm codes in the following weeks.

## Server

### Conditional Updates
We've added support for [conditional updates](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#cond-update).
This allows you to update a resource only if certain conditions are met.

### Migration to Async for FHIRPath and Canonical Resolution
Our fhirpath library and canonical resolution have been migrated to use async functions.
This is to allow for querying external services and databases for terminology and data.

### Worker migration to HTTP
Workers are separate processes we use for processing subscriptions and asynchronous tasks.
We've migrated these workers to use HTTP to communicate and pull data from our server.
This will allow us to scale workers horizontally and improve performance.

### GZip Compression
We've added support for GZip compression on all responses.

### Security

#### PKCE Support
We've added support for [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636).
This is a security feature that helps prevent authorization code interception attacks.
This will now be required for all authorization code flows. Our component library has been updated to make use of this feature.

#### CapabilityStatement Public
CapabilityStatements are now public for all tenants. This will allow clients to query the server for the capabilities of the server without needing to authenticate.

### Conformance Testing
Finished the initial round of conformance testing via [Touchstone](https://touchstone.aegis.net/touchstone). We currently have a 91% pass on the FHIR Standard R4 suite.

### Bug fixes
* We now allow undefined values on resources where the SD has a minimum set to 0 for the property.
