# Updates 2024-06-21

## Testing

### Migrations
We've finished migrating our API tests to TestScripts [here](https://github.com/IGUHealth/IGUHealth/tree/main/packages/server/testscripts/r4).
These tests are run on all PRs and the main branch.

### Publishing Test Reports
We now publish test reports on our main site. You can view them [here](https://iguhealth.app/reports).
These tests are generated off the main branch for the latest published version of our server.

### Support for Variables
Variables are now supported on our TestScript runner. You can use them to create dynamic parameters for your testscripts.
An example can be found [here](https://github.com/IGUHealth/IGUHealth/blob/main/packages/server/testscripts/r4/history.testscript.json)

### Support for Operations and Assertions
We now support the following operations and assertions:
* Assert: CompareToSourceExpression
* Operation: history
* Operation: patch
