# Updates 2024-05-08

## Support for External Message Brokers
We now support external message brokers. You can now configure your own [message broker](/documentation/Data_model/R4/MessageBroker) and [message topics](/documentation/Data_model/R4/MessageTopic) to send and receive messages between your services.

### Support for pushing messages to a message broker
#### Subscription
We support tying FHIR Subscriptions to message brokers. Read our documentation [here](/documentation/Messaging/Overview) on how to set this up.
#### API
We have added an API to push messages to a message broker. You can now push messages to a message broker by invoking the following operation on the [MessageTopic](/documentation/Data_model/R4/MessageTopic) resource:
```bash
POST /MessageTopic/${message-topic-id}/$message-post
{
"resourceType": "Parameters",
"parameter": [
{ "name":"input","resource": { "resourceType":"Patient" } }
]
}
```
Input can be any FHIR resource. The output of this operation is a code that represents the status of the message.

## Support for Basic Authentication
We now support basic authentication as a grant type for client applications.
When creating a client application, you can now specify `basic_auth` as a grant type, which will allow you to authenticate via
`Authorization Basic: ${btoa(username:password)}`

## Documentation for R4B FHIR
We have added documentation for the R4B FHIR version. You can now view the documentation [here](/documentation/Data_Model/R4B/Account).

## Search Documentation
We have added search functionality to the documentation. You can now do a full-text search for resources and operations on this site.
