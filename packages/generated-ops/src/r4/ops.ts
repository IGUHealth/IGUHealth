The server MAY return an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with additional information, and SHOULD do so if the response code is 400 or greater.<br/>\n    The client SHALL interpret a 4xx response to indicate that there is no point resubmitting the unaltered message, and a 5xx response to indicate an unexpected error occurred on the part of the server, with the implication that it may be appropriate to resubmit the original message. Doing so SHOULD NOT result in a duplicate message response. Repeated failures indicate either a fatal problem with the submission or a problem with the receiving application.\n\nThe following rules apply when using $process-message:\n\n* The operation only accepts POST transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error\n* The request content type submitted is always [Bundle](bundle.html) with type "message" containing a [Message Header](messageheader.html) resource as the first resource\n* The response content type returned is always [Bundle](bundle.html) with type "message" containing a [Message Header](messageheader.html) resource as the first resource, or an HTTP error\n* If the response is an error, the body SHOULD be an [Errors &mp; Warning](operationoutcome.html) resource with full details\n* The mailbox may be authenticated using standard HTTP authentication methods, including OAuth\n\nThe $process-message operation can be used by any HTTP end-point that accepts FHIR messages, not just FHIR RESTful servers.\n\nIn order to ensure consistency of processing, the [logical rules regarding processing of Bundle.id and message id](messaging.html#reliable) SHALL be followed when messages are processed using this operation.\n\nThe $process-message operation may be used synchronously, or asynchronously.\n\nThe following rules apply when using the $process-message operation synchronously:\n\n* The URL (http://server/base/$process-message) has no parameters\n* It is an error if the sender POSTs a message that requires multiple response messages\n* Servers SHALL accept multiple concurrent message submissions and process them correctly (they are allowed to process them sequentially internally, but multiple concurrent submissions is not an error in its own right)\n\nThe following rules apply when using the $process-message operation asynchronously:\n\n* The URL has at least one parameter: http://server/base/$process-message?async=true\n* The server acknowledges the message with a 200 OK with no body, or returns an HTTP error if the message cannot be processed\n* Accepting the message means that the server has understood the message enough to know where to respond\n* An [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) SHOULD be returned in either case\n* By default, the server responds by invoking the $process-message using the sender\'s stated end-point in the message: POST [MessageHeader.source.endpoint]/$process-messages]\n* Since the source end-point may be manipulated by message transfer engines, an alternative response address may be specified using the parameter "response-url": http://server/base/$process-message?async=true&amp;response-url=http://server2.com/base/anything.  The endpoint at the specified URL SHALL implement the signature of the $process-message operation (parameter async=true, accept a Bundle, return a 200 OK or an error)\n* The server submits response messages to the appropriate end-point with the parameter async=true. There is no response message for the response messages',

      'This operation is used to return all the information related to one or more patients described in the resource or context on which this operation is invoked. The response is a bundle of type "searchset". At a minimum, the patient resource(s) itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has that are related to the patient(s), and that are available for the given user. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, medications, locations, organizations etc.   \n\nThe intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their entire record (e.g. "Blue Button"), or for provider or other user to perform a bulk data download.  The server SHOULD return at least all resources that it has that are in the patient compartment for the identified patient(s), and any resource referenced from those, including binaries and attachments. In the US Realm, at a minimum, the resources returned SHALL include all the data covered by the meaningful use common data elements as defined in the US Core Implementation Guide. Other applicable implementation guides may make additional rules about how much information that is returned.',

    comment:
      "The key differences between this operation and simply searching the patient compartment are:    \n\n* unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging)  \n* the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). \n\nThis frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for, particularly with regard to included resources. Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the patient compartment. \n\nIt is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one, or can determine an appropriate list of patients to provide data for from the context of the request.   If there is no nominated patient (GET /Patient/$everything) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, the actual list of patients is all patients that the user associated with the request has access to. This may be all patients in the family that the patient has access to, or it may be all patients that a care provider has access to, or all patients on the entire record system. In such cases, the server may choose to return an error rather than all the records.  Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification (though see [The Smart App Launch Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch). \n\nWhen this operation is used to access multiple patient records at once, the return bundle could be rather a lot of data; servers may choose to require that such requests are made [asynchronously](async.html), and associated with [bulk data formats](formats.html#bulk). Alternatively, clients may choose to page through the result set (or servers may require this). Paging through the results is done the same as for [Searching](http.html#paging), using the [_count](search.html#count) parameter, and Bundle links. Implementers should note that paging will be slower than simply returning all the results at once (more network traffic, multiple latency delays) but may be required in order not to exhaust available memory reading or writing the whole response in a single package. Unlike searching, there is no inherent user-display order for the $everything operation.

Clients can work through large flat expansions in a set of pages (partial views of the full expansion) instead of just getting the full expansion in a single exchange by using offset and count parameters, or use the count parameter to request a subset of the expansion for limited purposes. Servers are not obliged to support paging, but if they do, SHALL support both the offset and count parameters. Hierarchical expansions are not subject to paging and servers simply return the entire expansion.  \n\nDifferent servers may return different results from expanding a value set for the following reasons:  \n\n* The underlying code systems are different (e.g. different versions, possibly with different defined behavior) \n* The server optimizes filter includes differently, such as sorting by code frequency \n* Servers introduce arbitrary groups to assist a user to navigate the lists based either on extensions in the definition, or additional knowledge available to the server\n\nWhen a server cannot correctly expand a value set because it does not fully understand the code systems (e.g. it has the wrong version, or incomplete definitions) then it SHALL return an error. If the value set itself is unbounded due to the inclusion of post-coordinated value sets (e.g. SNOMED CT, UCUM), then the extension [http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-unclosed](extension-valueset-unclosed.html) can be used to indicate that the expansion is incomplete",
